## Hi, I'm Mike 👋

I’m a Product Manager with hands-on experience building small technical projects
to better understand AI systems, data pipelines, and developer workflows.

This GitHub is a mix of:
- 🧪 **Hobby / exploration projects** (self-directed learning)
- 🎓 **Course-based projects** (structured, time-boxed)
- 🧠 **Product thinking artifacts** (design docs, PRDs, experiments)

I’m not a full-time engineer — these projects exist to deepen my product judgment,technical empathy, and system-level understanding.
