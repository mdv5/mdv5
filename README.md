## Hi, I'm Mike 👋

I’m a Product Manager with hands-on experience building small technical projects
to better understand AI systems, data pipelines, and developer workflows.

This GitHub is a mix of:
- 🧪 **Hobby / exploration projects** (self-directed learning)
- 🎓 **Course-based projects** (structured, time-boxed)
- 🧠 **Product thinking artifacts** (design docs, PRDs, experiments)

I’m not a full-time engineer — these projects exist to deepen my product judgment,
technical empathy, and system-level understanding.


## Hobby Projects
These are projects developed for personal use or learning.

## Course Projects
These projects were part of courses and are a mix of team based and individual projects.

### Text to Speech
[Text-to-speech Repo](https://github.com/mdv5/text-to-speech) This team project was created to help commuters catch up documents saved for offline reading, by having it read to them on the move leveraging the Google Text to Speech API.


## Labs
These specific labs created for hands-on learning of an individual technology
